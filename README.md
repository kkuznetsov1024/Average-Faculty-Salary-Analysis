# Average-Faculty-Salary-Analysis
Analysis of average faculty salaries with respect to location and type of institution 

Data set:
Data source is https://data.ed.gov/dataset/college-scorecard-all-data-files-through-6-2020. Analysis isolated 25 columns to find any correlation between parameters.

Objective:
To allocate location and types of institution for faculty members to strive for when looking for full-time position.

Process:
Data cleaning, wrangling, and correlation matrix were performed. 
Linear regression model was build to find correlation between Math SAT scores and average faculty salary. Locations were analyzed using Tableau. K-means clustering algorithm was used to break data into clusters using Jupyter Notebook.

Solution:
3 states were identified as the best states to work. Universities that offer graduate degrees were established to have the highest salaries. Correlation was found between Math SAT scores of incoming students and average faculty salaries.
